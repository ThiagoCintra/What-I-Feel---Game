ABSTRACT

Digital games, regardless of gender or platform, are a form of entertainment geared towards people of all ages. Children, young people and adults often find themselves immersed in fictional worlds. From this immersion, emotions are awakened in the player, which define their experience during the game as striking or not. Computer games produce "complex and dynamic emotional manifestations" and it is believed that the game has emotional power comparable to that of other media. This research will present the emotions of the human being and what defines them, how they are aroused and what elements the games use to thrill their players. The main objective of this research is to present the study on some factors capable of influencing the degree of immersion that the game can cause to the player. To achieve this goal, it was necessary to seek knowledge about emotions and their triggers, the psychology of colors, the relationship between sounds and emotions and the dynamics of gameplay. The interest in this theme was due to the fact that games are media elements, full of narratives and, like any narrative, presents specific items so that the player can identify, becoming an object of study. To form the theoretical basis, the theories of Paul Ekman and Plutchik were of great importance, since these authors made the emotions their objects of study. This research involves quantitative and qualitative data, thus being a mixed research. Also it is classified with a bibliographical research, since it is elaborated from material already published; and as a case study, because a thorough study was made from the material found. To present the results obtained by this project, will be elaborated the prototyping of two phases of the game What I Feel, which illustrates two aspects of the emotions studied: happiness and fear.
Keywords: Emotions. Psychology. Color theory. Immersion and Digital Games.
